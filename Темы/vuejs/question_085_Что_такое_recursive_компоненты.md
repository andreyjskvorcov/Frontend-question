# 85.  ### Что такое recursive компоненты?

The Components that can recursively invoke themselves in their own template are known as recursive components.
     ```javascript
     Vue.component('recursive-component', {
       template: `<!--Invoking myself!-->
                  <recursive-component></recursive-component>`
     });
     ```
     Recursive components are useful for displaying comments on a blog, nested menus, or basically anything where the parent and child are the same, eventhough with different content.

     **Note:** Remember that recursive component can lead infinite loops with `max stack size exceeded` error, so make sure recursive invocation is conditional(for example, v-if directive).
