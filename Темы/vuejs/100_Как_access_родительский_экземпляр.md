# 100. ### Как access родительский экземпляр?

The $parent object refers to the **immediate outer scope**. The parent will be accessible as `this.$parent` for the child, and the child will be pushed into the parent’s $children array. It establishes a parent-child relationship between the two instances(parent and child). You can access parent data and properties similar to $root.
