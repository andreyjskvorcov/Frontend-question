# 87.  ### Как make sure vue приложение is CSP complaint?

Some environments(Google Chrome Apps) prohibits the usage of `new Function()` for evaluating expressions and the full builds of vue applications depends on this feature to compile templates. Due to this reason, the full builds of VueJS application are not CSP complaint. In this case you can use **runtime-only** builds with Webpack + vue-loader or Browserify + vueify technology stack through which templates will be precompiled into render functions. This way you can make sure VueJS applications are 100% CSP complaint.
