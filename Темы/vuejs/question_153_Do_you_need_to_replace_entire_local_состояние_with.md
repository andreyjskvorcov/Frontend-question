# 153. ### Do you need to replace entire local состояние with vuex?

No, if a piece of state strictly belongs to a single component, it could be just fine leaving it as local state. i.e, Eventhough vuex used in the application, it doesn't mean that you need to keep all the local state in vuex store. Other the code becomes more verbose and indirect although it makes your state mutations more explicit and debuggable.
