     **Note:**
     1. If the page uses a production/minified build of Vue.js, devtools inspection is disabled by default so the Vue pane won't show up.
     2. To make it work for pages opened via `file://` protocol, you need to check "Allow access to file URLs" for this extension in Chrome's extension management panel.
