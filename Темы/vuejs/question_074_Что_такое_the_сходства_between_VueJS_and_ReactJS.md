# 74.  ### Что такое the сходства between VueJS and ReactJS?

Even though ReactJS and VueJS are two different frameworks there are few similarities(apart from the common goal of utilized in interface design) between them.
     1. Both frameworks are based on the **Virtual DOM** model
     2. They provide features such Component-based structure and reactivity
     3. They are intended for working with the root library, while all the additional tasks are transferred to other libraries(routing, state management etc).
