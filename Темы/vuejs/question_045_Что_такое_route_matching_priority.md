# 45.  ### Что такое route matching priority?

Sometimes the URL might be matched by multiple routes and the confusion of which route need to be mapped is resolved by route matching priority. The priority is based on order of routes configuration. i.e, The route which declared first has higher priority.
     ```javascript
     const router = new VueRouter({
            routes: [
              // dynamic segments start with a colon
              { path: '/user/:name', component: User } // This route gets higher priority
              { path: '/user/:name', component: Admin }
              { path: '/user/:name', component: Customer }
            ]
          })
     ```
