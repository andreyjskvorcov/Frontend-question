# 86.  ### Как resolve circular dependencies between компоненты?

In complex applications, vue components will actually be each other’s descendent and ancestor in the render tree. Let's say componentA and componentB included in their respective templates which makes circular dependency,
     ```javascript
     //ComponentA
     <div>
       <component-b >
     </div>
     ```
     ```javascript
     //ComponentB
     <div>
       <component-b >
     </div>
     ```
     This can be solved by either registering(or wait until) the child component in `beforeCreate` hook or using webpack's asynchronous import while registering the component,

     **Solution1:**
     ```javascript
     beforeCreate: function () {
      this.$options.components.componentB = require('./component-b.vue').default
     }
     ```
     **Solution2:**
     ```javascript
     components: {
      componentB: () => import('./component-b.vue')
     }
     ```
